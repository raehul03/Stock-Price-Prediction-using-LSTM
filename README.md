Main Obsjective is to to design and implement an LSTM-based machine learning model to predict future stock prices based on historical data, leveraging the ability of LSTMs to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data.
LSTMs, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), overcome this limitation by incorporating memory cells, making them ideal for tasks like stock price prediction where past trends influence future outcomes.
Dataset: Historical stock price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance via yfinance library)
